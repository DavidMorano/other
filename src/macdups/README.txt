DUPS

This program takes file-names on its standard-input (or the
command-line arguments) and sorts them (collates them really) into
groups that share a moderately common basename.  It then prints out
all of the collated entries that have two or more files within them.

Synopsis:
$ dups [<file(s)>] [-]
