LIBUO

This is a special library used to satify some symbols that would
otherwise be found in the LIBUC library.  This library was tailored
for use by the programs within the OTHER repository.  Using this
library allows for the elimination of the LIBUC library as a
dependency.  Some other symbols that are not included here (in this
library) are satisfied by several semi-secret interfaces found
within the LIBU library.
